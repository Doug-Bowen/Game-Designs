Other expansions ideas:

Blockades 
Items that sit between your treasure cards and your overkill damage. also items that sit on your bench

Quests 
we have a deck of cards that all have 1 goal on them. 
we shuffle them and deal three to each player.
you keep them hidden and you try to accomplish them for additional treasure points at the end of the game. 
upon accomplishing them, you reveal them
when the game ends, these are bonus points tacked on.  Similar to ticket to ride.
example: banish 2 knights | heal for 50 HP | have (at any time) 20 cards in your hand | purchase 3 rouges | kills 3 scouts


Monsters (A dark force has been awoken)
Use a dice as a turn counter, at turn 5? flip a card from the monster deck(id like all monsters to be a biomachine warrior race) place that card on top of the treasure pile.  Players now may only attack the monster.  At the end of each turn roll a dice, if >10? then the monster hits your champion.
