Playing the game:
---Taking a turn: 
----Each turn, the monster player will draw 1 card from either his Attack deck or Mana deck if available.  He may then attach/detach any equipment cards he has (by uitilizing the cards in his hand) and then may play either 1 attack or mana card and follow the instructions on the card.  Monsters are not limited by mana, so feel free to use magic attacks without the worry of mana cost. THey also have no bench.
----Winning the game:
----The Monster loses, if he is Banished.
----The Monster wins, if he eliminates all Kings teamed up against him.
