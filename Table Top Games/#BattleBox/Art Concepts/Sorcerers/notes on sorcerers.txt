Keep:
Violet
Valencia
lady dara

Overhaul:


Tweak:
Fletcher. I would keep the idea, but totally change the drawing.  Its rough, and I dont care for the look of the hands.

Luna is a girls name, but luna looks like a male here.  I would tweak this somehow, (idk how) but i relly like luna's look so we could just change the name.  your call.  although her name is based off of her ability to control the moon.

I would redraw master belian.  hes solid, but needs a better drawning (that might also happen when we finalize drawings.  up to you when this happens.
