Keep:
Foxy
Shakuul

Overhaul:
Leodak.  While I like his idea, i have such a hard time not seeing this character and being "pasted together".  This might just be me.  Also, we have a lot of "cat-like" people so this might be a chance to branch out.

Pertros.  It's too much like Shrek meets Yoda.  I like the idea of a small assassin though.  

Desonier.  I cant tell if hes humanoid or not, maybe change to be an obvious non-huminoid. I like the face, I dont care for the hands or jacket.

Tweak:
