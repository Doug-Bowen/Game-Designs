Keep:
Cornelius
Ebenezer
Ezra
Icarus

Overhaul:
Luther almost looks like a sorcerer here.  I would go with somethign drastically different.

Tweak:
Poncho's body seems awkward to me, almost disproportional.  ALso, I think he would be an easy character to change to a different race considering you'd only have to change his head/hands/feet.
