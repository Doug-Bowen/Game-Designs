Keep:
Nutly
Tinker -- you chould change his race if you care to (to make it more alien)
Gad

Overhaul:
Gaston's weapon doesnt really fit his ability, maybe we can think of someway to show he mimics things (not 100% how on this one)

Tweak:
Let's make maxwell a girl.  it's names after my wife :)

I wouldnt change the idea of Britz. I would just flesh it otu more.
decide on an actual robert and go with the girl on the bottom of the image that you drew.
