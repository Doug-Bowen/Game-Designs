Keep:
Lionheart.  hes not "spacey" but hes so friggin cool
Lord eldak


Overhaul:
so i have to ask if you like the idea of Coda.  originally it was sort of a joke and i dont think it fits well.  we sort of forced a dog-man into the game and i think its a bit odd.  We can keep him if you like, but it doesn say "alien" or "spacey" to me.  Although other characters dont either this one feels different.  probably because it was originally a joke.


Tweak:
Xerxes looks too much like a spawn character.  I would probably just redrawn him, losing a little bit of detail.

Sir cale. I like sircal and that he matches bain, i just dont care for the sword.  I would change the sword to a normal blade.
