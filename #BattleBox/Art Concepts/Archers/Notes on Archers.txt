Keep:
Bowen
Carter
Corrath

Overhaul:
Furlong is too cliche.  I know hes one of the early ones we drew, but I think he needs an overhaul.

Tweak:
Everyone who sees Belfore complain abotu the neck, he problem is that I love the neck.  I would tone the neck down a bit.  Other than that we like him.

Bain is so awkward to me.  I dislike the bow (proportionally) and can't understand his legs.  I like the idea with the helmet and the shoulder spike.
